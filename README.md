# Application of Kelly Criterion model in Sportsbook Investment

## Abstract

  The investment in sportsbook industry is very popular in Europe and United States but not yet in Asia. I tried to refer to *Dixon and Coles (1996)*, *Karlis and Ntzuofras (2005)* and some others papers to complete my **®model** *®γσ, Eng Lian Hu (2016)*^[1st paper in [3. References]] but the return is not stable and I try to apply Kelly model and generates an impressive returns which is in section [1. Kelly Criterion].
  
  The section [2. Comparison of Betting Strategy in Sportsbook Investment] will not only compare the staking model in betting model validation *®γσ, Eng Lian Hu (2016)*^[2nd paper in [3. References]]. and also Kelly model in section 1 but also enhanced.

## 2. Sportsbook Investment Portfolio

  By conduct above betting model and get a positive and impressive returns from the experiments, here I have try to retrive the betting model of British sportsbook consultancy firm A.
  
  Besides, by refer to [3. References] I try to build a simple shinyApp for betting model prior to build up my own **Scibrokes®** business website...

### 2.1 Investment Portfolio


### 2.2 Web Base App

**betting-models** shinyApp

  Based on [Betting-Strategy-and-Model-Validation](https://github.com/scibrokes/betting-strategy-and-model-validation), in order to test the risk of ruin, here I focus on English soccer leagues which will write as an shinyApp and set few elastic adjusters to test the efficiency of the sportsbook investment fund :
  
  - the initial fund size
  - betting stakes
  - average follwed odds price (volatility of odds price, ets, arima and garch models.)
  - missing followed bets
  - investment fund portfolio management (markotwitz and Kelly criteria)
  - regular investor refill or pump into initial fund pool
  
  Secondly, application of own *Rmodel* [Odds Modelling and Testing Inefficiency of Sports Bookmakers](https://github.com/scibrokes/odds-modelling-and-testing-inefficiency-of-sports-bookmakers) to test the efficiency and comparison.
